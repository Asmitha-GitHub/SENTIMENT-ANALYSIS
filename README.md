DESCRIPTION OF TASK 4:During the continuation of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions, guided by my mentor Neela Santosh, I was assigned Task 4 under the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This task focused on performing sentiment analysis on textual data using various NLP techniques and machine learning models.

For this task, I selected the widely used Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which contains over 299,000 reviews from Amazon users, including review text, ratings (1–5), product information, and reviewer details. My analysis was based on the Text and Score columns, which I used to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

The project was developed entirely using Python in Jupyter Notebook, with libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, NLTK, and scikit-learn.

To start, I loaded the dataset and conducted initial exploration — checking data structure, missing values, and value distributions. I then preprocessed the text data through a series of NLP steps including:

Converting text to lowercase

Removing punctuation and numbers

Eliminating stopwords

Tokenization and stemming

After preprocessing, I created a new Sentiment column based on the Score values:

Scores 4–5 labeled as Positive

Score 3 as Neutral

Scores 1–2 as Negative

To convert textual data into numerical format for model training, I used TF-IDF vectorization. I then split the dataset into training and testing sets and trained classification models like Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

Each model was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also used confusion matrices and visualized the sentiment distribution using seaborn.

Through this task, I gained a deeper understanding of NLP pipelines and the importance of proper text preprocessing for improving model performance. I also learned to interpret sentiment trends from real-world customer feedback and extract useful insights from unstructured data.

Overall, Task 4 significantly improved my ability to build NLP-based classification models and gave me practical exposure to text analysis — one of the core applications of modern AI systems.
