DESCRIPTION OF TASK 4:During my internship with CodTech IT Solutions, under the guidance of mentor Neela Santosh, I was assigned a project involving Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective was to process and analyze textual data and classify sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

I selected the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which contains over 299,000 reviews of food products. The dataset includes fields such as Summary, Text, Score, and Helpfulness, which provided a rich base for natural language sentiment classification.

ðŸ”§ Steps I followed:
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and removed unnecessary columns like Id, UserId, ProfileName, etc.

Combined Summary and Text columns for more expressive reviews.

Converted the Score column into sentiment labels (Positive/Negative/Neutral).

Applied text-cleaning operations (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Used visualizations like countplots to understand the distribution of sentiment classes.

Checked the balance of labels to ensure model fairness.

Feature Extraction:

Used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert the text data into numerical features for model compatibility.

Model Building:

(Optional/Bonus) Built a simple Logistic Regression model for classification.

Evaluated the model using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Insights:

Most reviews are positive, followed by neutral, and negative.

Text data preprocessing significantly impacts model performance.

ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK

Scikit-learn for vectorization and model building
